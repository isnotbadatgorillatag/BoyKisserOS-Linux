   <h3><b>BoyKisser OS</b> is a Linux distribution <b>made for silly boykissers</b>, based on ArchLinux and NyarchLinux.</h3><br />

</div>

## Is it safe to use?
BoyKisser OS is **not recommended as a daily driver**. Bugs and issues may occur, and the distro is not developed by a large team of experts.  
If you want a similar experience with fewer risks, try [Nyarcher](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/Nyarcher), a script to install BoyKisser customizations on top of any other Linux distro with Gnome preinstalled.  

BoyKisser OS uses **Arch Linux standard repositories**, so normal packages will receive regular updates independently of our project.  

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, check [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchLinux/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidance.  

## Why Gnome?
Gnome is our initial desktop environment because:  
- It has smooth, well-curated animations  
- GTK apps and Gnome are touch- and laptop-friendly, great for being a silly boykisser!
- Elegant, modern, and customizable  
- GTK apps look consistent and coherent  

Cons:  
- Users coming from Windows might find it unfamiliar (partially solved by BoyKisser Customize)  
- Gnome extensions may break after updates (especially relevant for a rolling release distro)  
- Non-GTK apps may look inconsistent  

## Other DE Spins
Planned future spins:  
- Hyprland  
- KDE Plasma  

# THANKS TO NYARCH
Thank you nyarch for the fork! 
Big huge shoutout to nyarch! Love you all!

We aim to keep each spin coherent with the philosophy of the desktop environment. For example, Komikku (a GTK manga reader) is included in the Gnome spin. For KDE Plasma, a QT-based alternative would be included. Contributions are welcome; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchLinux/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
